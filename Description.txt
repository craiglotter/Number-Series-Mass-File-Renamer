Number Series Mass File Renamer

Number Series Mass File Renamer is a very basic program that simply renames all files in a specified folder in such a way that they form a simple integer series that can be sorted alphabetically. For instance, a folder containing three files, namely a.jpg, b.jpg and c.jpg would become 1.jpg, 2.jpg and 3.jpg respectively. The series starting numeric can be specified. Note that the folder search is not recursive in nature but instead just a simple single level approach.
